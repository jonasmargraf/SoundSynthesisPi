# SoundSynthesisPi

This repository is a mirror of the GitLab repo used for the seminar Sound Synthesis, taught in the 2019 summer semester at TU Berlin by Henrik von Coler with assistance from me.

In this class, all students use identical Raspberry Pi platforms to develop their own custom synthesis engines that can be controlled via OSC and MIDI.
